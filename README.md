# 2048 Game with AI Mode

This is a Python implementation of the popular "2048" game with an added AI mode using basic decision-making algorithms. The game features manual controls for the player and an option to enable AI that automatically makes moves.

## Features

- **Game Mechanics:**
  - Move tiles left, right, up, or down.
  - Merge tiles of the same value.
  - New tiles appear on the grid after each move.

- **AI Mode:**
  - Toggle AI mode with the `AI MODE` button or the spacebar (`SPACE` key).
  - AI will automatically make moves every 300 milliseconds.
  
- **Game Over/Win:**
  - The game ends when there are no more moves available.
  - The game is won when the 2048 tile is reached.

- **Animations:**
  - Smooth animations for tile movements and merges.
  - The scale of the newly created tiles adjusts based on their animation progress.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for the graphical interface)

### Installing Pygame

If you don't have Pygame installed, you can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/1akin1/2048-ai-expectimax.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd 2048-ai-game
Run the game:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Use the arrow keys to play manually, or press the spacebar to toggle AI mode.

Key Bindings
Arrow Keys:
Up, Down, Left, Right: Move tiles in the corresponding direction.
Spacebar: Toggle AI mode (AI will start making moves automatically).
R: Reset the game.
Mouse: Click the "AI MODE" button to toggle the AI mode on/off.

Game Development & AI
The AI uses a simple evaluation function that looks at:
The number of empty cells.
The maximum tile value on the grid.
The gridâ€™s monotonicity (arrangement of tiles in a non-decreasing order).
The game grid is implemented as a 4x4 matrix with integer values, and the player interacts with it through keyboard inputs.
